# Minority_Argumentation_ClimateChange
Repository for Detecting Minority Arguments for Mutual Understanding:  A Moderation Tool for the Online Climate Change Debate, submitted as a manuscript to COLING 2022.

The paper entails three scripts:

1) Classification using RobBERT (sequence classification model)
2) Query-by-committee strategy (active learning) to obtain uncertain posts and predict arguments using the trained committees
3) Pattern extraction from each argument using Colibricore and log likelihood calculations
